  "about": "Hello and welcome to my website! My name is Salman and I was informally known as the “Bug Master” at my previous company, Flipp because not only was I great at finding issues within the software, I addressed these issues to the best of my ability as well. When joining a new organization or team, I seek opportunities for growth and facilitate inclusivity especially as the organization evolves. I have completed my Bachelor of Science degree specializing in Computer Science and Software Engineering from the University of Toronto Scarborough and I’m looking forward to applying what I have learned throughout my career. Feel free to contact me using the contact information listed above",
